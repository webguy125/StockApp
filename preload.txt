Hi Claude - please read the previous working session file for context only:

  Previous file (READ ONLY): C:\StockApp\session_files\session_notes_2026-01-22_predictions_webpage_integration.md

CRITICAL: All session updates MUST be APPENDED to today's file:
  C:\StockApp\session_files\session_notes_2026-01-23.md

DO NOT create new files like "_part2" or "_continuation".
DO NOT overwrite. ALWAYS APPEND using the Edit tool.

============================================
CANONICAL SESSION FILE RULES (READ DAILY)
============================================

1. You must use exactly ONE session file per day.
   Filename format: session_notes_YYYY-MM-DD.md
   Directory: C:\StockApp\session_files

2. If today's file does not exist, create it immediately.
   Include a header:
   SESSION STARTED AT: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

3. All updates must be appended to the current working file for the day.
   NEVER EVER create files like session_notes_2026-01-01_part2.md
   NEVER EVER create files like session_notes_2026-01-01_continuation.md
   ONE FILE PER DAY. APPEND ONLY. Use the Edit tool to append.

4. Every update must include a timestamp:
   [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] <update text>

5. Never delete or rename old session files.
   They form the permanent historical archive.

6. Always save files to:
   C:\StockApp\session_files

============================================
END OF RULES
============================================

============================================
CRITICAL CODING RULE - READ DAILY
============================================

NEVER EVER USE EMOJIS IN PYTHON CODE

- Windows console uses cp1252 encoding
- Emojis (checkmarks, arrows, boxes) cause UnicodeEncodeError
- Use plain text: [OK], [FAIL], [WARN], ===, ---
- NO: checkmark, X, warning, box-drawing characters
- This applies to ALL Python files (.py)

============================================
END OF CRITICAL RULE
============================================

============================================
CRITICAL DATABASE POLICY - READ DAILY
============================================

1. NEVER modify databases directly (neither master_market_data nor turbomode databases)
2. ALL changes must be implemented in code - databases are read-only from my perspective
3. Waiting for your instructions before proceeding with any tasks

============================================
END OF DATABASE POLICY
============================================

============================================
CODE FORMATTING POLICY - READ DAILY
============================================

When displaying code to the user, use this EXACT format:

CORRECT FORMAT (colorized, no wrapper):
```python
def example_function(param1, param2):
    """This is how code should look."""
    result = param1 + param2
    return result
```

Key rules:
- Use ```python for syntax highlighting
- NO borders/boxes around the code block
- Code appears directly for easy copy/paste
- The triple backticks are MINIMAL wrapping, not borders

============================================
END OF CODE FORMATTING POLICY
============================================

SESSION START TIME: 2026-01-23 09:59

============================================
PENDING FUTURE TASKS (Options ML System)
============================================

The Options ML System is 100% operational in rules-only mode.
Three tasks remain to enable full ML hybrid scoring (40% rules + 60% ML):

1. FUTURE TASK 1: Accumulate 30 days of real data
   - Use options system daily on Top 30 symbols
   - Run track_options_outcomes.py daily at 4:30 PM ET
   - Database: C:\StockApp\backend\data\options_logs\options_predictions.db
   - Target: 2000-3000 labeled examples

2. FUTURE TASK 2: Train ML ensemble on real data (after 30 days)
   - Run: python backend/turbomode/options_data_collector.py
   - Run: python backend/turbomode/options_feature_engineer.py
   - Run: python backend/turbomode/train_options_ml_model.py (3-4 hours)
   - Expected: Test AUC > 0.75, Win rate 75-80%

3. FUTURE TASK 3: Enable hybrid scoring (40% rules + 60% ML)
   - Restart Flask server after training completes
   - Models auto-load on startup
   - Hybrid scoring activates automatically
   - Frontend displays ML component (XGB/LGB/CAT probabilities)

NOTE: These tasks will be removed from this startup message
      after all three are completed.

TODAY'S TODO LIST - Updated 2026-01-11 19:08
============================================

COMPLETED TODAY (2026-01-11):
[X] DECIDED: Option 1 selected (disable NNs, fast path)
[X] Modified train_turbomode_models.py to exclude tc_nn_lstm, tc_nn_gru
[X] Trained meta-learner with 8 tree models (93.99% val accuracy!)
[X] Fixed scanner bug #1: Column name case mismatch (Volume → volume)
[X] Fixed scanner bug #2: Data threshold too strict (500 → 400 rows)
[X] Fixed scanner bug #3: Feature extraction method mismatch
[X] Fixed scanner bug #4: Dict-to-array conversion missing
[X] Verified all 9 models work (8 base + 1 meta)
[X] Tested predictions pipeline end-to-end
[X] System OPERATIONAL and PRODUCTION READY

PENDING TASKS:
[ ] Wait for Monday market open - test options page with live data
[ ] Quarterly curation (optional - checkpointed at 52/80 candidates)

CURRENT MODEL STATUS (2026-01-11 19:08):
✓ ALL MODELS TRAINED AND OPERATIONAL

Tree Models (8/8) - All trained Jan 11:

  - tc_nn_gru - Removed (architectural mismatch with tabular data)

SYSTEM STATUS:
✓ Scanner bugs fixed (4 critical issues resolved)
✓ Feature extraction pipeline working
✓ Model predictions working end-to-end

Scanner: TurboMode Scheduler (integrated in Flask)
Duration: ~60 minutes
Schedule: 11:00 PM (23:00) EVERY NIGHT
Status: ENABLED (but needs model retraining first)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MANUAL: Top 10 Stocks (Intraday Updates)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Symbols: SMCI, TMDX, TSLA, MTDR, CRWD, TEAM, BOOT, NVDA, KRYS, SHAK

   - Resolution: Expected Monday when markets open

FUTURE TASKS (After 30 Days):
[ ] Accumulate 30 days of real data for TurboOptions training
[ ] Train TurboOptions ML ensemble on real data
[ ] Enable hybrid scoring (40% rules + 60% ML)

============================================
END OF TODO LIST
============================================

============================================
INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE (READ AT EVERY SESSION STARTUP)
============================================

AT THE START OF EVERY SESSION, YOU MUST:

1. PRINT the TODO list above to the screen immediately
   - Show it in a clean, readable format
   - Use checkboxes to show pending/completed status

2. USE the TodoWrite tool to initialize your task tracking
   - Load all tasks from the list above
   - Mark tasks as in_progress/completed as you work

3. UPDATE this file (current_todos.txt) whenever:
   - A task is completed (change [ ] to [X])
   - A new task is added
   - A task is removed or becomes irrelevant
   - Keep this file synchronized with TodoWrite state

4. AT END OF SESSION:
   - Update this file with final TODO state
   - Remove completed tasks or mark them [X]
   - Ensure next session starts with clean, current list

This ensures continuity across sessions and we never forget tasks!
