Hi Claude - please read the previous working session file for context only:

  Previous file (READ ONLY): C:\StockApp\session_files\SESSION_NOTES_2025-12-31.md

CRITICAL: All session updates MUST be APPENDED to today's file:
  C:\StockApp\session_files\session_notes_2026-01-01.md

DO NOT create new files like "_part2" or "_continuation".
DO NOT overwrite. ALWAYS APPEND using the Edit tool.

============================================
CANONICAL SESSION FILE RULES (READ DAILY)
============================================

1. You must use exactly ONE session file per day.
   Filename format: session_notes_YYYY-MM-DD.md
   Directory: C:\StockApp\session_files

2. If today's file does not exist, create it immediately.
   Include a header:
   SESSION STARTED AT: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

3. All updates must be appended to the current working file for the day.
   NEVER EVER create files like session_notes_2026-01-01_part2.md
   NEVER EVER create files like session_notes_2026-01-01_continuation.md
   ONE FILE PER DAY. APPEND ONLY. Use the Edit tool to append.

4. Every update must include a timestamp:
   [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] <update text>

5. Never delete or rename old session files.
   They form the permanent historical archive.
