# ML SCAN STATUS - December 19, 2025

## CURRENT ISSUE: Page Not Updating After Scan

### What's Working ✅
- Scanner loads 503 S&P 500 symbols from Wikipedia
- Scanner loads 100 cryptocurrencies  
- Total: 603 symbols scanned
- Scan completes successfully (takes ~19 minutes)
- Emojis removed from console output (no more crashes)

### What's NOT Working ❌
- **Webpage doesn't refresh/update after scan completes**
- User must manually refresh page to see new data

### Performance
- **Current**: ~1.9 seconds per stock (19 minutes for 603 symbols)
- **Reason**: Data downloaded twice (scanner + analyzer)
- **Potential improvement**: Pass data from scanner to analyzer (~10 min for 603)

### Next Steps to Fix Page Update Issue

1. **Check if scan actually completes and saves data**
   - Monitor Flask console for "SCAN COMPLETE" message
   - Check ml_trading_signals.json timestamp updates

2. **Verify frontend JavaScript calls loadMLSignals()**
   - After scan completes, should call `await loadMLSignals()`
   - Should show alert with scan results

3. **Check for JavaScript errors**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for errors during/after scan

4. **Possible fixes**:
   - Add console.log to track when loadMLSignals() is called
   - Check if fetch('/ml-signals') is returning new data
   - Verify page isn't cached

### How to Test

1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ml-trading
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Click "Run Scan"
4. Wait ~19 minutes
5. Check if alert appears
6. Check if page updates

### Expected Behavior

After scan completes:
- Alert: "Scan complete! Scanned 600+ symbols, Showing top 100 signals"
- Page refreshes automatically  
- Tab shows: "All Signals (100 of 603)"
- Footer shows: "100 (scanned 603)"
