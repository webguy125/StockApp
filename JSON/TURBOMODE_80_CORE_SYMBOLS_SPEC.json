Enhancements in v1.2.0 include variable thresholds for key criteria by sector and market cap bucket to address feasibility in underrepresented areas (e.g., lower liquidity sectors like Utilities or small caps), based on market data showing skewed options activity toward Tech/Large Cap. This makes the universe more balanced while maintaining quality.",
