TODAY'S TODO LIST - Updated 2026-01-11 19:08
============================================

COMPLETED TODAY (2026-01-11):
[X] DECIDED: Option 1 selected (disable NNs, fast path)
[X] Modified train_turbomode_models.py to exclude tc_nn_lstm, tc_nn_gru
[X] Trained meta-learner with 8 tree models (93.99% val accuracy!)
[X] Fixed scanner bug #1: Column name case mismatch (Volume → volume)
[X] Fixed scanner bug #2: Data threshold too strict (500 → 400 rows)
[X] Fixed scanner bug #3: Feature extraction method mismatch
[X] Fixed scanner bug #4: Dict-to-array conversion missing
[X] Verified all 9 models work (8 base + 1 meta)
[X] Tested predictions pipeline end-to-end
[X] System OPERATIONAL and PRODUCTION READY

PENDING TASKS:
[ ] Wait for Monday market open - test options page with live data
[ ] Quarterly curation (optional - checkpointed at 52/80 candidates)

CURRENT MODEL STATUS (2026-01-11 19:08):
✓ ALL MODELS TRAINED AND OPERATIONAL

Tree Models (8/8) - All trained Jan 11:
  - xgboost (gbtree) - 87.24% val accuracy
  - xgboost_et (ExtraTrees) - BEST BASE MODEL
  - xgboost_approx
  - xgboost_hist
  - xgboost_dart
  - xgboost_gblinear
  - lightgbm
  - catboost

Meta-Learner (1/1):
  - meta_learner - 93.99% val accuracy (stacks 8 models)

Neural Networks: DISABLED
  - tc_nn_lstm - Removed (architectural mismatch with tabular data)
  - tc_nn_gru - Removed (architectural mismatch with tabular data)

SYSTEM STATUS:
✓ Scanner bugs fixed (4 critical issues resolved)
✓ Feature extraction pipeline working
✓ Model predictions working end-to-end
✓ PRODUCTION READY

AUTOMATED SCANNING SCHEDULE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
AUTOMATED: Full 82 Stocks (Overnight Scan)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Symbols: All 82 curated stocks from core_symbols.py
Scanner: TurboMode Scheduler (integrated in Flask)
Duration: ~60 minutes
Schedule: 11:00 PM (23:00) EVERY NIGHT
Status: ENABLED (but needs model retraining first)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MANUAL: Top 10 Stocks (Intraday Updates)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Symbols: SMCI, TMDX, TSLA, MTDR, CRWD, TEAM, BOOT, NVDA, KRYS, SHAK
Scanner: backend/turbomode/top10_scanner.py
Duration: ~7 minutes
Status: Will work after model retraining

KNOWN ISSUES:
[CRITICAL] Models not fully trained
   - Cause: Jan 10 training crashed during meta-learner phase
   - Resolution: Rerun training pipeline

Options page: "No liquid options found" error
   - Cause: yfinance OI data = 0 for all stocks (weekend data issue)
   - Resolution: Expected Monday when markets open

FUTURE TASKS (After 30 Days):
[ ] Accumulate 30 days of real data for TurboOptions training
[ ] Train TurboOptions ML ensemble on real data
[ ] Enable hybrid scoring (40% rules + 60% ML)

END OF TODO LIST
============================================

============================================
INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE (READ AT EVERY SESSION STARTUP)
============================================

AT THE START OF EVERY SESSION, YOU MUST:

1. PRINT the TODO list above to the screen immediately
   - Show it in a clean, readable format
   - Use checkboxes to show pending/completed status

2. USE the TodoWrite tool to initialize your task tracking
   - Load all tasks from the list above
   - Mark tasks as in_progress/completed as you work

3. UPDATE this file (current_todos.txt) whenever:
   - A task is completed (change [ ] to [X])
   - A new task is added
   - A task is removed or becomes irrelevant
   - Keep this file synchronized with TodoWrite state

4. AT END OF SESSION:
   - Update this file with final TODO state
   - Remove completed tasks or mark them [X]
   - Ensure next session starts with clean, current list

This ensures continuity across sessions and we never forget tasks!
